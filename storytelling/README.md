# Data Structures

In this folder, I am making documents to show my though processes in data exploration, management, and visualizations.

**Anomalies**
* _site-traffic-anomalies_: I am exploring how to find a specific date in which a Google algorith change occured, which would effect traffic visits to a website. _**In R Markdown Language**_.

**Astropy Introduction**
* _astropy-tutorial_: I am exploring the astropy package and how to look at FITS files. _**In Jupyter Notebook**_.
