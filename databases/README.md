# Databases

In this folder, I am exploring different ways of making databases:

**Databases:**
* _astro-database_: A prototype of an astronomy database meant to collect celestial objects. I am trying out how to make the program suitable for production here. _**In C Language**_.

* _simple-database_: A simple database for exploration of the concepts _**In C Language**_.
