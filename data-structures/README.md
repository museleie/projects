# Data Structures

In this folder, I am exploring different applications of data structures. 
Some of these include:

**Sorting Algorith:**
* _selection-sort: I am applying selection sort into an array. _**In Java, Python Languages**_.

**Binary Trees:**
* _binary-tree_: I am mirroring (left-to-right) of a binary tree, as well as flipping it (up/down) and displaying the results. _**In Java, Python Languages**_.

**Graphs:**
* _edge-traversal_: I am exploring edge traversal and determining if the graph has a cycle  _**In C++ Language**_.
