# Data Structures

In this folder, I am exploring different applications of data structures. 
Some of these include:



**Arrays:**
* _average-grade-calculator_: I created a program to collect, computer, and display grades in a class. _**In Java Language**_.

**Binary Trees:**
* _binary-tree_: I am mirroring (left-to-right) of a binary tree, as well as flipping it (up/down) and displaying the results. _**In Java, Python Languages**_.

**Graphs:**
* _edge-traversal_: I am exploring edge traversal and determining if the graph has a cycle.  _**In C++ Language**_.



**Algorithms:**
* _selection-sort_: I am applying selection sort into an array. _**In Java, Python Languages**_.

* _number-guessing-game_: I created a program that would allow for a user to guess a computer's number, as well as allow the computer to guess the user's number, in 7 attempts or less. _**Python Language**_.
